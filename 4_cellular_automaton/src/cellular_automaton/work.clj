;;; Your task is to implement cellular automaton.
;;; The most famous example of cellular automaton is Conway's Game of Life.
;;; Unlike previous tasks now you have to implement both visualization and bots. So you need to implement everything :)
;;; I suggest to use quil library for animation (it was used in all previous tasks): https://github.com/quil/quil
;;; or you can use whatever you want.
;;; Keep in mind that is should be simple to run your simulator with different automata (Game of Life is only one example of many).


;;; Implement and run Brian's Brain automaton in your simulator: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain


;;; Implement Wireworld automaton: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld


;;; Add Wireworld implementation to Rosetta Code (it's not present here yet): http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Wireworld


;;; Implement Von Neumann cellular automaton: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_cellular_automata


;;; Implement Langton's ant: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant


;;; Add ability to change cells states by mouse click, to restart and pause simulation.
