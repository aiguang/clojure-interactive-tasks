This repo is a collection of interactive tasks created to help you practise clojure. Interactive task is clojure project that contains some exercises, you solve them and check. There is no automatic checking system, you check it manually. Solutions are visualised so you look at it and decide whether it good or not by yourself. Some tasks require math and algorithms. Check tasks below to see screenshot examples.

**Instructions**

1. Install java and leiningen if you don't have them.
2. Choose task (any folder except `misc`).
3. Open `$TASK_NAME/src/$TASK_NAME/work.clj` file to read excercises.
4. Solve them.
